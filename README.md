# Hi, I’m Yuriy (@ymelnykov)

My name is Yuriy Melnykov and I live in the city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. I have 23+ years' experience of work as a research associate in the field of metal forming and metallurgy and as a translator. When the war came to my country, I lost my job and took it for an opportunity to switch my career and become an IT specialist, of which I was thinking for many years, but couldn't bring myself to. I was 45 then, but did venture upon it. Since that moment I've successfully finished a number of professional courses, completed 9 web projects, many labs and solved dozens of problems of different scope and complexity. I keep on studying and find it very exciting.

Now, I feel myself prepared to apply my newly acquired skills in a professional setting and am interested in getting a new job.

## My Skills
