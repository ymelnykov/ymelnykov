# Hi, I’m Yuriy (@ymelnykov)

My name is Yuriy Melnykov and I live in the city of Zaporizhzhia, Ukraine. I have 23+ years' experience of work as a research associate in the field of metal forming and metallurgy and as a translator. When the war came to my country, I lost my job and took it for an opportunity to switch my career and become an IT specialist, of which I was thinking for many years, but couldn't bring myself to. I was 45 then, but did venture upon it. Since that moment I've successfully finished Scientific Computing with Python (freeCodeCamp), CS50's Introduction to Computer Science (Harvard University), CS50's Web Programming with Python and JavaScript (Harvard University) courses, had some training in using Google Cloud Platform, completed 7 web projects, 8 labs and solved dozens of problems of different scope and complexity. I keep on studying and find it very exciting.

Now, I feel myself prepared to apply my newly acquired skills in a professional setting and am interested in getting a new job.

## My Skills

- SQL, SQLite
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
